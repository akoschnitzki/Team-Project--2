# Team-Project--2


Hello World,


In our project, we were able to show our game that we were able to create. We created a game
that you are abe to guess the number that is random each time that you play. It will be able to  
tell you to guess higher or lower if you do not guess it right away. You can keep playing
unitl you do not want to play no more. This program is a fun game to play to be able to 
guess the random number.
